# CATEGORY_MAPPING defines how banking or credit card transaction categories are mapped
# to Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) categories.
# 
# This mapping allows user spending data to be compared against national averages 
# from BLS datasets. It is customizable â€” feel free to modify or expand it to better 
# align with the specific categories returned by your financial institution or desired 
# analytical breakdowns.
